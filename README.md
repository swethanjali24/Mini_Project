# 📊 Mini Project: Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

## 📁 Project Description

This project is a hands-on notebook designed to help students and beginners understand the core concepts of **Descriptive** and **Inferential Statistics** using Python.  
The notebook uses small, simulated datasets to manually and programmatically calculate various statistical measures and apply foundational statistical tests.

## 🧠 What You Will Learn

### ✅ Descriptive Statistics:
- Mean, Median, Mode (with examples and manual calculation)
- Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
- Interquartile Range (IQR)
- Five-number Summary and Boxplot interpretation
- Types of data and Levels of Measurement (Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio)

### ✅ Inferential Statistics:
- Confidence Interval for a Population Mean
- One-Sample Z-Test (One-tailed and Two-tailed)
- Formulating hypotheses
- Z-score calculation and interpretation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- `pandas` – Data manipulation  
- `numpy` – Numerical computation  
- `statistics` – Basic statistical operations  
- `scipy.stats` – Z-test, percentile, etc.

## 💡 Example Outputs

### ✅ Confidence Interval
Sample Mean = 162
Standard Error = 1
95% Confidence Interval = (160.04 cm, 163.96 cm)


### ✅ Z-Test Summary
Sample Mean = ₹31,000
Population Mean = ₹30,000
Z = 1.43
Critical Z = ±1.96
Conclusion: Fail to reject H₀
